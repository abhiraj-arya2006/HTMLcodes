          >Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
          kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
          normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
          word is used. Sports commonly called football include association
          football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football
          (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
          rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league);
          and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying
          extent common origins and are known as football codes.There are a
          number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball
          games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes
          of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
          English public schools during the 19th century.</b

          leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss

      <h2>Table-Tennis</h2>
      <p>
        Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in
        which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the
        ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The
        game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the
        initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a
        ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table,
        and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least
        once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within
        the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball
        alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the
        hitter a great advantage.

        Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International
        Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes
        226 member associations.The table tennis official rules are specified in
        the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,
        with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's
        singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008,
        a team event has been played instead of the doubles.
