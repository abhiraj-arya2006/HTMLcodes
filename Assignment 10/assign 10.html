        Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an
        organism. Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains
        essential nutrients , such as carbohydrates,fats,proteins,vitamins, or
        minearals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by
        the organism's cells to provide energy,maintain life ,or stimualte
        growth.

      <p class="nine">
        Historically humans secured food through two methods
        <span class="ten">hunting and gathering and agriculture,</span> which
        gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet. Worldwide humanity hs
        created numeerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of
        ingredients,herbs,spices,techniques, and dishes.
      </p>
      <p class="eight">
        Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing
        population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety
        and food security are monitored by agencies like the International
        Association for Food Protection,World Resources Institute, World Food
        Programme,Food and Agriculture Organisation, and International Food
        Information Council. They address issues such as
        sustainibility,biological diversity,climate change,nutritional
        economics.population growth,water supply, and access to food.

        The right to food is a human right derived from the
        <span class="ten"

          Rights(ICESCR)</span
