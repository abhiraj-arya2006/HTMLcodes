        <h1>Global Warming</h1>
        <h1>A Major Cause</h1>

    <p id="one"><u>About :</u></p>
    <p class="three"><span class="two">Global Warming is the temperature of Earth's surface,</span> oceans and atmosphere going up over tens to thousands of years. Average temperatures today are about 1 °C (1.8 °F) higher than before the Industrial Revolution, which started around 1750, during the Little Ice Age, an abnormally cold period.</p>


    <p class="two">But in some parts of the world it is less than this and some more. <span class="three">Some scientists say that by the year 2100 temperatures will be 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) to 5 °C (9.0 °F)</span> higher than they were before 1750. The most noticeable changes because of this increase in temperature is the melting of ice caps all around the world. Sea level is rising steadily because of continental ice melting into the sea. Many cities will be partly flooded by the ocean in the 21st century.</p>

    <p class="three">Among <span class="two">the greenhouse gases,</span> the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming, as predicted by Svante Arrhenius a hundred years ago, confirming the work of Joseph Fourier more than 200 years ago. When people burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas this adds carbon dioxide into the air.</p>

    <p class="two">This is because <span class="three">fossil fuels contain lots of carbon and burning means joining most of the atoms in the fuel with oxygen.</span> When people cut down many trees (deforestation), this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by those plants.</p>

    <p class="four">As the <span class="two">EARTH'S SURFACE TEMPERATURE BECOMES HOTTER WHEN SEA LEVEL BECOMES HIGHER.</span> This is partly because water expands when it gets warmer. It is also partly because warm temperatures make glaciers and ice caps melt. The sea level rise causes coastal areas to flood.Weather patterns, including where and how much rain or snow there is, are changing. </p>

    <p class="five">Deserts will probably increase in size. Colder areas will warm up faster than warm areas. Strong storms may become more likely and farming may not make as much food. These effects will not be the same everywhere. The changes from one area to another are not well known.</p>
