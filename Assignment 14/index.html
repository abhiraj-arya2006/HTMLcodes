    <hr>
    <p class="four">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or just simply Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869. He was an Indian lawyer and a nationalist too.Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to stay for 21 years.His role to fight for independence was very much. He was leader of some of the most effective and important movements like Salt movement and Simon Go back. At last he died at the age of 79 years on 30 January 1948. And Gandhiji's birthday is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti in our country every year on 2 October.

    <h2 class="three">Bhagat Singh</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="four">Bhagat Singh (1907 â€“ 23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement.In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, British India, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai, by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured, and, two weeks after which, died of a heart attack. Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru, a marksman.He was then shot several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.</p>
